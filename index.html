        <h3>Web development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code in 2019 when I joined a three-week software development course and found I enjoyed the content more than I was expecting. During the pandemic I decided to start some online courses and further my knowledge so
          that I could expand into the tech industry.

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I've been interested in photography since I was around 13 years old, I was big into riding bicycles with my friends at that age and would take my pocket camera everywhere with me and document the world around me. After finishing college I
          decided to do a bachelor's degree in photography at Middlesex University.

        <h3>Computers</h3>
        <p>During my time at university I found my love for computers and all things computer related!
          I've built a number of computers, repaired CPUs, GPUs and even built my own keyboard.
          Somewhere along the line I fell into the role of being the IT guy for my friends and family which only gave me more excuses to tinker with computers.
